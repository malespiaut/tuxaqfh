TUX-AQFH Change Log.
====================

TUX-AQFH v1.0.14 (Sept 2nd 2002)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Updated to use PLIB 1.6.0

TUX-AQFH v1.0.12 (Jul 12th 2001)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Updated to use PLIB 1.4.1

  * Changed ssgLoadAC's to ssgLoad's so now you can
    make models using any supported file format.

  * Fixed a new bug that appeared in the water model.

TUX-AQFH v1.0.11 (Jul 12th 2000)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Configure file fixed for PLIB 1.3

TUX-AQFH v1.0.10 (Feb 11th 2000)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * The 1.0.9 release had some debug code left in it - that's
    now been removed.

  * The model for the Refrigerator in level 3 was broken.

  * The 'moon' level had a whale in it (!) instead of having
    no air.  Don't even *ask* how that happened!

  * The trees and some electric fences were missing - that was
    due to a bug in PLIB 1.1.10, so this release requires
    PLIB 1.1.11

TUX-AQFH v1.0.9 (Feb 10th 2000)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * This version of Tux_AQFH requires PLIB 1.1.10 or later.
    Upgrading to the latest PLIB will fix a number of crashing
    problems.

  * Fixed a bug in the loader that caused Tux_AQFH to crash for
    more recent PLIB Versions.

  * Fixed MSVC++ v6 compilation error in tux.cxx (Thanks Keiji Kato!)

TUX-AQFH v1.0.8 (Oct 3rd 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Removed magic fullscreen/windowed switch for Voodoo cards
    because it doesn't compile for non-Voodoo cards and it won't
    be needed under Mesa 3.1 *soon*.

  * Fixed a path problem in one of the '.ac' files.

  * Fixed a bug in level.cxx - I failed to fclose the level.dat
    file.

  * Got rid of a 'sleep' and provided my own string compare
    routines so this stuff will compile under Windoze again.

  * Thanks to Ingo Ruhnke, we now have a 'make install'
    that works. It places the data files into:

      /usr/local/share/games/tux_aqfh/*

    ...and the executable into:

      /usr/local/games/tux_aqfh

  * Also thanks to Ingo, Tux will try to find the appropriate
    datafiles no matter where it's run from. The rules
    are:

    + If the '-D path' option is set on the command line,
      look there only...else...
    + If the "TUX_AQFH_DATADIR" environment variable is
      set, look there...else...
    + If it looks like we are cd'ed to an appropriate
      distribution directory - or one level down from
      there, then use that...else...
    + If the '-DTUX_AQFH_DATADIR={path}' option was
      provided at compile time, look there. (You can
      set this by providing the '--prefix={path}'
      option when you run the './configure' script...
      else...
    + If all else fails, the hard-coded path:
      /usr/local/share/games/tux_aqfh is used.

  * The 'building_levels' document is now much
    more complete.

  * Changed '@switch' objects to '@switchon'
    and '@switchoff'.

  * Cleaned out unimplemented menu entries from GUI.

  * Fixed problem in mouse interface that prevented
    Help/About/Credits/History screens from showing up.

TUX-AQFH v1.0.7 (Aug 4th 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Couldn't resist adding an ASCII Tux to the
    startup message.

  * Removed ability to start game on any level.

  * Implemented '-h' and '--help' command line
    options.

  * '--gown' and '--tux' are now synonyms for
    '-g' and '-t' command line options.

  * Game save/restore now implemented. The '-r' and
    '--reset' command line options reset the game to
    the beginning.

  * Added '.tux_aqfh_rc' file support - you can setenv
    TUX_AQFH_RC to some alternative name if you'd prefer.
    This file is loaded on program start and rewritten
    whenever you return to the Antechamber unless you just
    died.

  * Added a 'contrib' directory for assorted contributions
    to Tux_AQFH. Currently it contains a script from
    Andreas Umbach to setup for a 3Dfx card and then run
    Tux.

  * Created a central point from which the player
    leaves to do a level...and (typically) will
    return to when it's complete. I call this the
    "Antechamber" - and it makes the game much
    more convenient to use.

  * Changed level files to allow 'EXIT' to arbitary
    level.

  * Moved all the Gold Herring so there are actually
    two per level as advertized. put some of them
    in more sneaky locations. You'll have to work
    MUCH harder to get them now!

  * Did a fair bit of other 'tidying up' in most of
    the levels.

  * The water in the 'Frogger' level is now lethal.

  * There is a prize in the race level if you can do it
    in under a minute.

  * Lots of minor changes for MSVC.

TUX-AQFH v1.0.6 (July 10th 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Fixed a broken texture that screwed up the
    flag in level zero.

TUX-AQFH v1.0.5 (July 8th 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Added a 'VERSIONS' entry to the menu so
    it's easy to find which version you have
    and which version of PLIB/MESA you are using.

  * Added SLAM - a simple interpreted language
    for specifying model movement.
    Checkout doc/slam.html

  * Tux now sticks to moving surfaces so he can
    ride on platforms, etc.

  * Gown now has a higher pitched voice than Tux.

  * MOD format music added.

  * Music can now be different for each level.

  * Documented the LEVEL file format - check out
    doc/levels.html

  * Stopped the race timer from appearing in other
    levels.

  * Arranged for music to continue to play while
    we switch levels.

  * Prevented signon messages from cluttering the
    display after a keypress or joystick button.
 
TUX-AQFH v1.0.4 (June 3rd 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Added first cut at the 'Frogger' level (level 4)

  * You can now play as 'Gown' (Tux's Girlfriend)
    by passing the '-g' parameter on the command
    line.

  * All text and menu's now drawn using the 'fnt'
    library.

  * Fixed a problem where ssgInit was being called
    before GLUT had opened the window.

  * Fixed missing <time.h> for Windoze (that was
    supposed to be in 1.0.3 - sorry!)

  * Moved a lot of level-specific hacks out of the
    code and into the levelXX.dat files where it
    belongs. Check out doc/levels.html

  * Can position camera initially for each level.

  * Fixed a couple of problems with Tux consuming
    more that one 'life' each time he dies.

  * Reduced the distance that Tux can jump by
    about x2.

  * Try harder to work out if XMesa calls are available.

TUX-AQFH v1.0.3 (May 9th 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Changed a few things that MSVC complains about.

TUX-AQFH v1.0.2 (May 8th 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * New configure.in derived from the PLIB one
    should work better for CygWin.

  * Minor warnings from some compilers eliminated.

TUX-AQFH v1.0.1 (April 17th 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * First public release.

  * Swapped 'life' and 'energy' displays.

  * Added support for Mouse controls

  * Fixed a number of minor portability
    issues so that TUX now runs on SGI machines
    under IRIX.  This also showed up a couple
    of latent bugs.

  * Switched build mechanism to 'autoconf/automake'
    which greatly simplifies the build instructions.

TUX-AQFH v1.0 (April 1st 1999)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * First private release.

From Andreas Umbach:

  For anyone with a 3dfx card who has a little trouble with that fullscreen
  & environment thing I put the tux_3dfx.sh script into the tux_aqfh
  directory (in my case: /usr/local/src/tux_aqfh-1.0.6/). Then you can
  start tux with

    cd /usr/local/src/tux_aqfh-1.0.6      (or whereever you put it)
    sh tux_3dfx.sh                        (or whatever you named it)

Steve Says:

  I edit the script to include the 'cd <wherever tux is installed>' into
  the script, then I can put the script into /usr/local/tux and start
  the game just by typing 'tux' or 'tux -g'.

These files are the levels of the game.

Level 0 is the training level.
Level 1 is nothing special - the first level I built actually.
Level 2 is the same as level 1 but in winter.
Level 3 is the Volcano level - it's a 'real' level and it's quite
           hard.
Level 4 is a 'Frogger' clone.
Level 5 is a race. Walk *though* the stripey start line to start
           the clock. Follow the purple arrows and get across the
           finish line as fast as possible.
           The record is a shade under 50 seconds.
Level 6 is something we put together after watching a stunt biker
           jump from one rooftop to another.
Level 7 is an outer space level. Low gravity, that kind of thing.

The_End is where you go if you get past the highest numbered level.

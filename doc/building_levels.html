<H1>A Guide To Writing New Levels for Tux.</H1>
The steps involved in building a new level for the
Tux game are rather involved, so let's take you through
the steps one at a time:
<H1>What's in a Level?</H1>
There are the components that every level needs:
<ul>
<li>A text file in the <code>data</code> directory
    named <code>level<b>N</b>.dat</code> where 'N'
    is the number of the level.  Level Zero is reserved
    for the "Training Level", Levels 1 through 7
    are 'special' because they can be reached from
    the 'anteroom' whilst levels 8 though 9997 can
    only be reached via earlier levels. The 'levelN.dat'
    file contains the names of all the other files that
    make up the level.
<li>A '.MOD' format music file for the sound track
    for the level.
<li>A file describing the geometry for the level. At
    time of writing, this has to be in AC3D format.
    Eventually, other formats will be possible.
<li>One or more geometry files describing features that
    are included in this level - and possibly shared with
    other levels.
<li>Some texture maps.
<li>Files that are used to script the behaviour of other
    creatures in the level.
</ul>
<H1>Coordinates.</H1>
3D coordinate are in the same units throughout the
game - with the scale set such that Tux is just under
two units high.  You can think of this as one foot
per unit if you imagine Tux to be about two feet high
- which is probably about right for a Penguin.
<p>
I'm from a flight simulation background, so I think
of X and Y being "East" and "North" respectively
with Z being "Up".  However, some modellers (such
as AC3D) treat Z as "North" and Y as "Up"...the
AC3D loader switches them around for you, so treat
Y as "up" when you are building things in AC3D.
<H1>The <code>data/levelN.dat</code> file.</H1>
Each level of the game is defined by a 'level' file.
The level files are stored in the 'data' directory
and are named 'levelN.dat' where 'N' is the level
number.
<p>
The 'level' files are ASCII text with each line
of text being a record.  Records that start with '#'
are comments and will be ignored.
<p>
Some lines in the file will change the behaviour
of the game, others will cause 3D objects to be
loaded into the scene.
<H2>Coordinates</H2>
In many cases, the 'level' file only requires you
to input an X and Y coordinate - in those cases,
the Z coordinate (height) is determined from the
highest point in the scenery loaded up to that point.
<p>
This makes it important to keep the lines in the
level files in the right order. If you want a
golden herring on top of a box, you must list
the 3D model containing the box BEFORE the herring,
and the herring will be placed on top of the box.
<H2>Behaviour Records.</H2>
<pre>

  CAMERA &lt;pan&gt;,&lt;elevation&gt;,&lt;range&gt;,&lt;follow&gt;

</pre>
This sets the initial camera position relative to Tux.
pan and elevation are in degrees, range is in the
same units as the rest of the database with is in units
that are about half the height of Tux. The 'follow'
flag is '1' if the camera should initially follow Tux,
'0' if it should not.
<pre>

  SKY &lt;red&gt;,&lt;green&gt;,&lt;blue&gt;

</pre>
Sets the sky colour (actually, the clear-screen colour) - each
colour component is in the range 0..1.
<pre>

  OCEAN
  ICE
  LAVA
  BLACKHOLE

</pre>
Puts in a layer of translucent water, ice or opaque lava at zero
altitude throughout the scene. The BLACKHOLE setting puts a black
surface 20 units below zero altitude - and arranges that Tux will die
if he falls that far. You don't have to include any of those options,
but then it'll be your responsability to ensure that there are no
holes in the scenery through which Tux could fall. If you did that,
Tux would continue to fall forever and the game would effectively
be locked up.
<pre>

  MESSAGE &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;,&lt;radius&gt;,&lt;line1&gt; &lt;line2&gt;

</pre>
This causes a message to pop up whenever you get within
the specified radius of the specified coordinate. The
altitude of the test point is set at the height of the
terrain at the point. The text of the (two-line) message
is set in line1 and line2. Replace spaces in the message
with underscores.  eg:
<code>MESSAGE  10,20,5,Tux_the_Penguin A_Quest_for_Herring</code>
Messages have to be fairly short in order to fit into the
limited space available on-screen. Since Tux uses a proportionally
spaced font, it'll take some experimenting to see what the
longest possible message is.
<pre>

  LIFE &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;

</pre>
Puts an extra 'life' for Tux at the specified coordinate at an
altitude measured from the highest point on the terrain.
<pre>

  YHERRING &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;
  GHERRING &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;
  SHERRING &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;
  RHERRING &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;,&lt;type&gt;

</pre>
Places a yellow (Gold), green, silver or red herring at the specified
coordinate. The 'type' field <b>could</b> be applied to any colour
of herring - but conventionally is only applied to Red herrings.
<p>
Type is one of:
<pre>

  SUPERTUX -- Turn Tux into 'Super Tux'
  ROCKET   -- Give Tux a rocket pack.
  GUN      -- Give Tux a rocket pack with a laser gun.
  PARTYHAT -- Give Tux a Party-Hat
  BOWTIE   -- Give Tux a BowTie
  SHADES   -- Give Tux a cool pair of shades.

</pre>
Other types will be added over time.  There must NEVER be more
than two gold herring within a single level. I think there
should probably never be just one either since the player will
be expecting to find two and it would be unfair to force him to
search for something he'll never find.
<pre>

  TELEPORTER &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;

</pre>
Places a teleporter at the specified coordinates.
Each teleporter sends Tux to the next one in the
level file - and the last one sends him back to
the first.
<pre>

  WHALE &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;,&lt;heading&gt;

</pre>
Places 'Freeware Willy' - the killer whale at the specified
coordinate - just below zero height - pointing in the
direction specified by 'heading'. This had better be in
some nice deep water!
<pre>

  TUX &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;,&lt;heading&gt;
  TUX &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;,&lt;zcoord&gt;,&lt;heading&gt;,&lt;pitch&gt;,&lt;roll&gt;

</pre>
Places Tux at the specified location - facing towards the
specified heading.
<pre>

  RACE &lt;time_limit&gt;,&lt;prize_handle&gt;

</pre>
This is for 'race' levels. To win the race, you have to
reach the finish line before 'time_limit' is reached. If
you succeed then &lt;prize_handle&gt; is turned OFF (which removes
the glass case around the gold-herring prize).
<pre>

  EXIT &lt;xcoord&gt;,&lt;ycoord&gt;,&lt;where&gt;

</pre>
Creates an exit building (models/folly.ac) at the specified
location. 'where' is either the number of another level, or
9999 to take you back to the start room. The 'magic' value
-1 is reserved for the start room and has a very special
meaning associated with that room.  The game ends if Tux hits
an exit to a level that does not exist. Please use '9998'
for that 'game over' level.
<pre>

  HEAT &lt;temp&gt;

</pre>
Sets the rate at which Tux heats up just by
being in this level. Most levels will be zero
(which is the default), the hottest level so
far is set to 0.04 degrees C per frame.
<pre>

  SPACE_HELMET

</pre>
Tux appears wearing a space helmet.
<pre>

  NO_AIR

</pre>
Indicates that this level has no breathable
atmosphere. (eg Underwater or Outerspace)
<pre>

  SQUISH_PAIN &lt;pain&gt;

</pre>
Sets the amount of pain Tux suffers when he is squashed
flat. The default is three units. This is used to
make Tux die when squished in the Frogger level.
<pre>

  MUSIC "mods/filename.mod"

</pre>
Selects the music to play during this level.
If no music is selected then whatever music was
playing before will continue to play. You can
set the filename to the empty string "" and the
music will be turned off for that level.
<pre>

  "filename" &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;,&lt;z&gt;,&lt;h&gt;,&lt;p&gt;,&lt;r&gt;
  "filename" &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
  "filename" &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;

</pre>
Places the 3D object specified by 'filename' (which should be
stored in the 'models' directory) at the specified position
and optional orientation.
<H2>Example 'levelN.dat' file:</H2>
Here is the level file for the Lava level. I have added a bunch of
extra comments to explain what each line does:
<pre>

</pre>
<H1>Model Files</H1>
Model files will eventually be loadable from a variety of file formats -
but right now, the only format I support is that of the 'AC3D' modeller.
(Files have the '.ac' extension).
<p>
Since AC3D files are quite limited in what they can express, I have
extended the file format by making use of comment fields.
<p>
Since it's quite useful to put real comments into a model, the game
only recognises comments that start with an AT ('@') sign. eg:
<pre>

  @invisible

</pre>
Some objects have 'handle' numbers associated with them, these
are also encoded into comment fields:
<pre>

  @123

</pre>
You can have both a handle number AND an at-comment:
<pre>

  @123@invisible

</pre>
Here are all the at-comments and what they do. In the description
below, square brackets ('[]') are used to indicate optional
syntax - don't type them into the comment field! Angle
brackets ('&lt;&gt;') indicate a variable field...don't type the
angle brackets either.
<ul>
<p>
<li>AUTODCS's:<pre>
    @autodcs [H=&lt;heading_rate&gt;][P=&lt;pitch_rate&gt;]
             [R=&lt;roll_rate&gt;][X=&lt;x_rate&gt;]
             [Y=&lt;y_rate&gt;][Z=&lt;z_rate&gt;]
             [C=&lt;cycle&gt;] [O=&lt;phase&gt;]
             [M=&lt;mode&gt;]
</pre>
This sets up an automatically moving object (A 'dynamic coordinate
system' to use an obscure flight simulation term). It is useful for
things that spin, move in a straight line, swing, etc. H,P,R,X,Y and Z
set the rate at which the object moves (in degrees/units per frame).
Any rates that are omitted will default to zero.
<p>
The 'cycle' term is the number of frames over which the animation
will cycle before it is returned to the starting point (in some
modes). If omitted, cycle defaults to zero - which causes the object
to continue indefinitely without resetting. 'mode' is a number in the
range 1 to 4 with the following meaning:
<ul>
<li>M=1 -- FORWARD: (The default) Add the specified rate terms to
           the object's coordinates every frame.
<li>M=2 -- CYCLE: Add the specified rate terms to the object's coordinates
           every frame until 'cycle' frames have elapsed - then reset
           to (0,0,0),(0,0,0). If 'cycle' is zero then this is the same
           as M=1.
<li>M=3 -- SHUTTLE: Same as M=2 except that the motion reverses after
           'cycle/2' frames so the motion runs back and forth.
<li>M=4 -- SINESHUTTLE: Same as M=3 except that the motion is
           sinusoidal - like the motion of a pendulum for example.
</ul>
When you have several animations running with the same cycle time,
you sometimes want them to run together in perfect sync - and in
other cases, you want them to run out of sync. The 'phase' value
(which defaults to zero) is added to the start frame number of the
animation.
<p>
Example: For a pendulum swinging over 240 frames:
<pre>
  @autodcs p=0.25 c=240 m=4
</pre>
<p>
<li>AUTOTEXtures:<pre>
    @autotex [H=&lt;heading_rate&gt;][P=&lt;pitch_rate&gt;]
             [R=&lt;roll_rate&gt;][X=&lt;x_rate&gt;]
             [Y=&lt;y_rate&gt;][Z=&lt;z_rate&gt;]
             [C=&lt;cycle&gt;] [O=&lt;phase&gt;]
             [M=&lt;mode&gt;]
</pre>
This does exactly the same thing as autodcs - except that instead of
the model itself moving, just the texture map moves. This is useful
for rendering things like waterfalls, slowly moving lava flows,
sparking or swirling effects.  The units of x_rate and y_rate are
texture map repeats in the S and T directions.  z_rate is rather
irrelevent (unless we ever get efficient 3D texture maps on affordable
hardware).
<p>
<li>BILLBOARDs:<pre>
    @billboard
</pre>
This causes the object to rotate to remain vertical - but turn to
face the 'camera'. This can be used to make trees and other complex
objects with approximate radial symmetry using just a single
polygon and an appropriate texture map.
<p>
<li>INVISIBLE objects:<pre>
    @invisible
</pre>
The object will never be drawn - but will be used for collision
detection. This is most often used to create invisible walls to
prevent Tux from falling off the edge of the 'world'.
<p>
<li>ANIMATE nodes:<pre>
    @animate &lt;start&gt; &lt;end&gt; &lt;time&gt; &lt;mode&gt;
</pre>
In this case, the object should have a number of daughter objects.
This command tells the renderer to render only one of those daughter
objects at a time. The renderer starts with object number 'start',
and ends with the object numbered 'end' - displaying each object
for 'time' number of frames. 'mode' is a single character:
<ul>
<li> O -- ONESHOT: The object cycles from 'start' to 'end' and then
          stops. The 'end' object is displayed continuously from
          then on.
<li> S -- SWING: The object runs from 'start' to 'end' and then
          reverses and runs from 'end' back to 'start' again...forever.
<li> C -- CYCLE: The object runs from 'start' to 'end' and then
          jumps back to 'start' and does it all over again...forever.
</ul>
<p>
<li>SWITCH nodes<pre>
    @switchoff &lt;handle&gt;
    @switchon  &lt;handle&gt;
</pre>
When Tux or Gown touches this object, it turns on or off another unrelated
object. When it is off, it is neither drawn no collided with in future.  This
is used to implement 'switch boxes' to turn on and off electric fences and
such.  The handle number has to be encoded into a comment in the
'target' object - as described above.
<p>
<li>SNOWBALL rechargers:<pre>
    @snowballs
</pre>
If Tux of Gown bumps into this object, their supply of snowballs will
be re-charged.
<p>
<li>SLAM-scripted objects:<pre>
    @slamdcs "filename" [&lt;arg&gt;]...
</pre>
This is still a somewhat experimental feature - but one with great
power for the level designer. The object containing this comment
will be moved around according to the commands in a 'SLAM' script
pointed to by the 'filename'. SLAM stands for Simple Language for
Animating Models - and it's a very simple C subset. (VERY - VERY
SIMPLE - No complaints about exactly how simple - OK?). The
optional "command line" can contain up to sixteen numerical
arguments that can be queried from within the SLAM-script. Check
out the <A HREF="slam.html">SLAM manual</A> for further details.
</ul>
<H1>The Terrain</H1>
In all the levels I have built, this is a single AC3D file that contains
the basic "Terrain" for the level.  There isn't really a reason why it
should all be in one big file like that - but I find it easier to
manage that way.
<p>
For most of the levels, I built about a 10x10 polygon 'grid' using
the AC3D grid tool, made it really big - at least a few hundred
'units' across. Then I recoloured it white and textured it with
an appropriate map - allowing a dozen or so map repeats across
the grid. It's your call though - there are plenty of other ways
to get started.
<p>
Now you can 'pull' the vertices of the grid around to make undulating
terrain, sharp dropoffs, etc.
<p>
For some levels, it's necessary to delineate "the edge of the world"
so that Tux won't fall off the edge - for others, an infinite sea
of lava or a deadly drop is sufficient. On levels where I do need
to make an artificial "edge", I build an invisible cube around the
world (any shape would do) and mark it with an '@invisible' comment
to prevent it being drawn yet still permit collision detection
to function.
<p>
You can model features directly onto the terrain - or add them
via the levelXX.dat file.  Make sure you place a 'folly' somewhere
in the level - or you will be unable to leave it.

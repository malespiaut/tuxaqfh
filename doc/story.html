<H3>By Steve Baker</H3>
I'm told that all good games have to have a story behind them.
I don't think I agree about that - but here goes.
<H2>Tuxedo T. Penguin: A Quest for Herring</H2>
Once upon a time, the world was full of herring and it was a happy time
for Penguins everywhere.
<p>
One dark night, the Killer Whales and the Leopard Seals (both long-time
enemies of the peace-loving Penguins) decided to join forces and hide all
the herring in places far from where Penguins live.
<p>
Penguins everywhere were starving and a great cry went up for a hero
to come forward and find the hidden herring - but who could stand up
against the Whales and the Seals?  Penguins are not known for their
adventurous natures after all.
<p>
Eventually, word went out over the PenguinNet and our heroes Tux and
Gown returned from their duties as Linux mascots to help out their
wild cousins.  But what could two solitary Penguins do against such
a large force of evil sea mammals?  Fortunately, help was at hand.
OpenSource hackers worked day and night to create teleportation devices
to whisk Tux and Gown to the places where the herring had been hidden.
These teleporters are powered by the rare and valuable Golden Herring
which our heroes must find to progress in their quest.
<p>
This angered the Seals and the Whales who thought this whole plan would
be foolproof and Penguins everywhere would go the way of the Dodo.  As
our starstruck young birds travelled to the South Pole, one of them was
captured by marauding mammals.
<p>
Can our remaining heroic Penguin find the missing Herring?  Will our
feathered friends be reunited in the final reel?  Their fate is in
your hands.
